My Story
Hi, I'm Cris Lourenz Tan. I’ve been passionate about photography and videography since high school. One of my greatest joys is crafting stories through editing. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills by immersing myself in visual learning and online resources, constantly refining my craft.

As a freelance editor, I landed my first client through Upwork, collaborating with them for a year on their YouTube channel. After gaining valuable experience, I decided to explore new opportunities and move forward in my freelancing journey. My next big break came when I began working with a popular local artist in the Philippines, Nash Aguas, in 2020. I was responsible for managing his artist Facebook platform and editing his gaming content. Through Nash’s referral, I expanded my network and worked with other well-known local artists, including Winwyn Marquez and Vitto Marquez. I edited their vlog content for YouTube, which allowed me to further develop my editing expertise. As my career progressed, I had the opportunity to work with Thinnd, a popular gaming YouTuber based in the United States. My role primarily involved editing his vlog content, an area where I excel due to my extensive experience.Throughout these projects, I realized the importance of adaptability and multitasking, as I often juggled various responsibilities while meeting tight deadlines. Each experience has shaped me into a versatile editor who thrives on creativity, collaboration, and delivering impactful content.
